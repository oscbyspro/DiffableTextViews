# FIXMEs

### NumberiTextStyles
    - Sign of number cannot be selected/copied because it is marked as prefixing.

# TODOs

### Utilities:
    - Import it as implementation only when the underscore is removed from: @_implementationOnly.

### Similarities
    - Rework it such that it is easy to test how it handles text with attributes.
    - Take a pen and a piece of paper and work out how it should *actually* work.

### NumericTextStyles
    - Trailing redundant characters should be removable. Remove trailing redundant characters if number is at max value.

### DiffableTextViews
    - Make models such as Snapshot conform to CustomStringConvertible for better debug messages.
