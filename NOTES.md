# FIXMEs

### NumberiTextStyles
    - Sign of number cannot be selected/copied because it is marked as prefixing.

# TODOs

### Similarities
    - Rework it such that it is easy to test how it handles text with attributes.
    - Take a pen and a piece of paper and work out how it should *actually* work.

### NumericTextStyles
    - Trailing redundant characters should be removable. Remove trailing redundant characters if number is at max value.

### DiffableTextViews
    - Replace nondescriptive errors with descriptive ones, so they can be printed during debug.
    - Use throwing methods because do/catch and try/throw actually makes the code less complex.
