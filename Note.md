# TODOs

### Similarities
    - Rework it such that it is easy to test how it handles text with attributes.
    - Take a pen and a piece of paper and work out how it should *actually* work.

### NumericTextStyles
    - Trailing redundant characters should be removable. Remove trailing redundant characters if number is at max value.
    - Consider implementing some parser structs as Copy-On-Write.

# FIXMEs

### NumberiTextStyles
    - Sign of number cannot be selected/copied because it is marked as prefixing.
